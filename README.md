# How to solve an issue: 

  - Create a new branch with the issue name on it. Don't work off and commit directly to master! 
  - Resolve the issue.
  - Create a PR and post screenshots of what the change looks like.
  
  - Also, if there's a change that needs to be done but there isn't an issue for it, create it first and then assign yourself.   
    We don't want people doing double work.
